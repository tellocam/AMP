\section*{To Do's}
\begin{itemize}
    \item either make framework work or create new framework
    \item analyze locks in lecture slides and in paper:
    \item \begin{itemize}
        \item Test-and-Set Lock
        \item Test-and-Test-and-Set Lock
        \item Ticket Lock
        \item Array Lock
        \item CLH Lock
        \item MCS Lock
        \item Hemlock (from paper..)
    \end{itemize}
    \item in the lectureslides from the project it says:
    \item \begin{itemize}
        \item Benchmark the following two under various scenarious, meaning low/high contention 
        \item Benchmark Throughput (probably locks-unlocks performed per time)
        \item Benchmark Latency 
        \item Benchmark for fairness, we have to think of some number to measure fairness, maybe locks/unlocks achieved per thread
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
